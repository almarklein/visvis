"""
Visvis is a pure Python library for visualization of 1D to 4D data in an
object oriented way. Essentially, visvis is an object oriented layer of
Python on top of OpenGl, thereby combining the power of OpenGl with the
usability of Python. A Matlab-like interface in the form of a set of
functions allows easy creation of objects (e.g. plot(), imshow(), volshow(),
surf()).

With visvis a range of different data can be visualized by simply adding
world objects to a scene (or axes). These world objects can be anything
from plots (lines with markers), to images, 3D rendered volumes,
shaded meshes, or you can program your own world object class. If required,
these data can also be moved in time.

Visvis can be used in Python scripts, interactive Python sessions (as
with IPython or IEP) and can be embedded in applications.

Requirements:
  * Numpy
  * PyOpengl
  * A backend GUI toolkit (PySide, PyQt4, PyQt5, wxPython, GTK, fltk)
  * (optionally, to enable reading and writing of images) imageio

usage:
import visvis as vv

All wobjects, wibjects and functions are present in the visvis
namespace. For clean lists, see vv.wibjects, vv.wobjects, or vv.functions,
respectively.

For more help, see ...
  * the docstrings
  * the examples in the examples dir
  * the examples at the bottom of the function modules (in the functions dir)
  * the online docs: https://github.com/almarklein/visvis/wiki
