""" Package visvis

Visvis is a Python visualization library that uses OpenGl to display
1D to 4D data; it can be used from simple plotting tasks to rendering 
3D volumetric data that moves in time. 

Visvis can be used in Python scripts, interactive Python sessions (as
with IPython or IEP) and can be embedded in applications.

Visvis employs an object oriented structure; each object being 
visualized (e.g. a line or a texture) has various properties that 
can be modified to change its behaviour or appearance. A Matlab-like 
interface in the form of a set of functions allows easy creation of 
these objects (e.g. plot(), imshow(), volshow()). 

Requirements:
  * Numpy
  * PyOpengl
  * A backend GUI toolkit (PyQt4 or wxPython)
  * (optionally, to enable reading and writing of images) PIL

usage:
import visvis as vv

Visvis is an object oriented visualization toolkit. There are two
types of objects that can be visualized: wibjects and wobjects. The
first are 2D objects that reside in a figure, axes or each-other.
In fact the Figure and Axes class are wibjects. Wobjects are objects
that reside in the 3D world inside an axes object. 

All wobjects, wibjects and functions are present in the visvis 
namespace. For clean lists, see vv.wibjects, vv.wobjects, or vv.functions, 
respectively.

For more help, see the docs, the examples in the examples dir, or 
the examples at the bottom of the function modules (in the functions
dir).
