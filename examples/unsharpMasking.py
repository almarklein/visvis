# There is a pre-loop section, that is executed before the anti-aliasing
# loop. We use this to modify the aliasing kernel so it always does a fixed
# amount of smoothing.
# In the post-loop section we combine the subtracted image with the normal
# sampled image. Unsharp masking consists of subtracting the smoothed image
# from the original (thus removing low frequency components), and then adding
# the result with a certain factor to the original.
#
# Note that the aa kernel is symetric; kernel[0] is the center pixel, and
# kernel[1] through kernel[3] is the tail on all ends.
