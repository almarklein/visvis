""" This example demonstrates how one can use two of the same cameras
on the same axes.

The axes keeps a list of cameras, and only allows one camera of each type.
Therefore, in order to have two of the same cameras, we need to subclass it.

Note that in this example, there are actually 3 TwoDCamera's, as the original
is also still available (on index 2).
