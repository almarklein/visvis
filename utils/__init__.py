""" Package visvis.utils

This package contains a few utilities that are not a core part of visvis.
Some utilities are used inside visvis (such as ssdf), others are purely
stand alone modules that have some relation to visualization.

The intended way to import utilities is: "from visvis.utils import utilname".

The currrent utilities are:

  * ssdf - simple structured data format.
  * graph - Representing points/nodes that are connected by edges.
